# Copy Note Contents

*A multi-function copy plugin for Obsidian (Plain text, Markdown raw, HTML)*

!\[Demo GIF – coming soon]

## Overview

This plugin adds one-click copy commands to Obsidian.
You can copy your notes as **plain text**, **raw Markdown**, or **HTML**, directly from the ribbon.
Tested with English and Japanese text. Useful for posting to Wattpad, Google Docs, or other platforms that don’t support Markdown formatting.

## Features

* Copy as **Plain text**
* Copy as **Raw Markdown** (no conversion)
* Copy as **HTML** (preserves italics and other formatting)
* Ribbon button for one-click access

## Limitations

* **RTF copy is not supported** due to Obsidian’s security model.
* Verified with Google Docs and Wattpad. Other platforms may strip some HTML formatting.
* Tested mainly with English and Japanese text.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Put the folder into `.obsidian/plugins/` inside your vault.
3. Enable the plugin from Obsidian’s settings.

## Maintenance Policy

⚠️ This repository is considered **abandonware**.
The plugin works, but I don’t plan regular updates.
I might tweak it if I’m bored — basically, maintenance is a D20 roll.
Forks and pull requests are welcome.
